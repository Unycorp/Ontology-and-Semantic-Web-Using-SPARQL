# Ontology-and-Semantic-Web-Using-SPARQL
This project uses Fuseki-server to run. The ontology was created with Protege in which an OWL filw was created. The OWL file was uploaded to Fuseki-server through Moxilla Fire Fox.
Note: After testing the different browser, we establish the fact that uploading of OWL file can only be done through Moxilla Fire Fox. This means that Google Chrome, Operamini or any other browser will not work
A full description about this project will be discuse shortly
